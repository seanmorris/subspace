Local Commands:
Local commands begin with a "/", like /login or /pub

It is recommended to use "/login" and "/register" to
perform the respective actions rather than  the bare
"login" and "register" as the UI will prompt for a
password separately rather than printing it to the
terminal.

Run "/commands" for the full list of local commands.

Server Commands
server commands are barwords like "pub", "sub" or
"unsub".

Run "commands" for the full list of server commands.
